I've released a new version of the robot framework plugin for
[brackets](http://brackets.io). Important new features include:

* syntax highlighting for argument files
* improved hinting
* bug fixes

To get the quickdocs feature you must be running the
[robot framework hub](https://github.com/boakley/robotframework-hub/wiki)

You should be able to ugrade using the brackets extension manager.
