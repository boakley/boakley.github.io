title: Brackets support for space-separated plain text robotframework files
---

I finally pushed the bits that allow the robot framework extension for
the brackets editor to support the space-separated format. That format
seems to be the preferred format for a lot of people, so hopefully a
few more people will start using brackets. 

Here are a few screenshots showing the robot framework acceptance
tests. The screenshots are from OSX, but it works just fine on
windows too.

My team doesn't use the space-separated format, so this code hasn't gone through very must testing. If you use the space separated format and notice some bugs or unexpected behavior, please submit a bug report here: https://github.com/boakley/brackets-robotframework/issues
