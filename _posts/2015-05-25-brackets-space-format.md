title: Brackets support for space-separated plain text robotframework files
---

I finally pushed the bits that allow the robot framework extension for
the brackets editor to support the space-separated format. That format
seems to be the preferred format for a lot of people, so hopefully a
few more people will start using brackets. This feature is available
starting with version 1.2.0 of the extension.

Here is a screenshot showing the robot framework acceptance
tests. The screenshots are from OSX, but it works just fine on
windows too.

My team doesn't use the space-separated format, so this code hasn't
gone through very must testing. If you use the space separated format
and notice some bugs or unexpected behavior, please submit a bug
report here:
