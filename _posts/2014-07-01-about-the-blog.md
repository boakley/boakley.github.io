title: About the blog

When people ask me what I do, I like to say that I write software to
test software.

I ended up here somewhat by accident. I worked as a UI designer and
developer of unix-based desktop applications for a good chunk of my
career (stretching back to the late 80's). Tool development was always
something I liked to do on the side, and I've always also been at
least tangentially involved in software testing.

A few years ago I found myself on a team that was asked to help deploy
a test automation solution for one of the larger online travel
websites. We built a fun team, did some cool stuff, and learned a
lot. Eventually I ended up following my manager to another gig where
we got to do that all over again. New team, same goals. At that second
place I had an even more amazing team, and we were quite 
successful. 

One downside to that gig was that we weren't allowed to give back some
of our work to the open source community. This was really important to
me, so when an opportunity presented itself to do this all again at
another company, along with being able to make the code open source, I
jumped at the chance.

I've been here a while now and some of the projects are starting to
see the light of day, so I figured it was time to start this blog. 
This gives me a place to write down the things I've
learned from the past, and the things I learn as we go through this
process one more time. 

I hope you find some of the information here useful.
