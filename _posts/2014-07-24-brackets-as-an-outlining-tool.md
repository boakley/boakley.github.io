For years (and years and years) I've used emacs as my primary editing
tool. I sometimes use its built-in outline mode, but more often then
not I just type into a never-ending buffer named "notes.txt". 

Lately I've been working on an 
[extension]({% post_url 2014-07-20-introducing-robot-extension-for-brackets %}) 
to the [brackets](http://www.brackets.io)
text editor for the [robot framework](http://robotframework.org). 
In order to eat my own dog food I'm slowing
starting to use brackets instead of emacs for my go-to text editor. 
Emacs is a hard habit to break!

Today I needed to do a little outlining, so I pulled up brackets and
created a new file named "notes.md" (.md is an extension for the
markdown format). I was pleasantly surprised to see that this works
quite well as an outliner. The markdown mode provides both syntax
highlighting and code folding for headers and lists. This
makes it easy to collapse and expand the sections of my outline as
I work. I'm not a "power outliner", so this is really all I need. 

Brackets is really starting to grow on me. Maybe one of these days
I'll write a more comprehensive review. If you aren't married to your
text editor -- or even if you are -- 
[brackets](http://www.brackets.io) is worth checking out.
